<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in the number of stray animals in Malaysia. Hence, this work proposed a web application called Save The Strays (STS) to manage these animals' welfare and help find new pet owners for better care. The chosen approach for the project development was the Agile+UX methodology. This project implemented the Laravel framework with MVC architecture for the backend implementation and Vue.js for frontend implementation. It also utilized PostgreSQL and Amazon S3 for data and file storage purposes. STS has undergone two types of testings, the Black Box and usability testing with actual users. The system testing phase resulted in a satisfying outcome as STS passed all conducted test cases and testers from usability testing were satisfied with the system. The finding suggested that STS is considered a platform to increase efficiency and optimize the process of stray animal adoption starting from adoption application until follow-up with new pet owners.</p>
