            <h3 class="alt-features-title font-alt"><b>Regular Exams Are Vital</b></h3>Your pet can get heart problems, develop arthritis, or have a toothache. The best way to prevent such problems or catch them early is to see your veterinarian every year. Annual vet visits should touch on nutrition and weight control, as well as cover recommended vaccinations, parasite control, dental exam, and health screenings.

            <h3 class="alt-features-title font-alt"><b>Spay and Neuter Your Pets</b></h3>It’s a procedure that can be performed as early as six to eight weeks of age. Spaying and neutering don’t just cut down on the number of unwanted pets; it has other substantial benefits for your pet. Studies show it also lowers the risk of certain cancers and reduces a pet’s risk of getting lost by decreasing the tendency to roam.

            <h3 class="alt-features-title font-alt"><b>Prevent Parasites</b></h3>Fleas can plague pets, and also can lead to irritated skin, hair loss, hot spots, and infection. It can also introduce other parasites into your cat or dog. All it takes is for your pet to swallow one flea, and it can end up with tapeworms, the most common internal parasite affecting dogs and cats. Year-round prevention is key. Regular flea and intestinal parasite control, as well as heartworm prevention in endemic areas, is important.

            <h3 class="alt-features-title font-alt"><b>Maintain A Healthy Weight</b></h3>Just like people, obesity in pets comes with health risks that include diabetes, arthritis, and cancer. Overfeeding is the leading cause of obesity, says Douglas, who adds that keeping our pets trim can add years to their lives. Because pets need far fewer calories than most of us think — as little as 185-370 a day for a small, inactive dog; just 240-350 calories daily for a 10-pound cat.

            <h3 class="alt-features-title font-alt"><b>Get Regular Vaccinations</b></h3>For optimal health, pets need regular vaccinations against diseases such as rabies, distemper, feline leukemia, and canine hepatitis. How often your dog or cat needs to be immunized depends on their age, lifestyle, health, and risks so talk to your vet about the vaccinations that make sense for your pet.

            <h3 class="alt-features-title font-alt"><b>Provide an Enriched Environment</b></h3>An enriched environment is another key to the long-term health and welfare of your canine and feline friends. Pets need mental stimulation which may mean daily walks for your pooch, and scratching posts, window perches, and toys for your cat. It means playtime with you, which not only keeps your pet’s muscles toned and boredom at bay, it also strengthens your bond with your four-footed companions.

            <h3 class="alt-features-title font-alt"><b>Dental Care</b></h3>Your pet can suffer from gum disease, tooth loss, and tooth pain. And just like you, regular brushing and oral cleanings help keep your pet’s teeth strong and healthy. Dental disease is one of the most common preventable illnesses in pets yet many people never even look in their pet’s mouths. In addition to regular dental cleanings by your vet, periodontal disease can be avoided by proper dental care by owners. Owner care includes brushing, oral rinses, and dental treats.

            <h3 class="alt-features-title font-alt"><b>Never Give Pets People Medication</b></h3>Medicines made for humans can kill your pet. As a matter of fact, in 2010 the ASPCA listed human drugs in the top 10 pet toxins. Human drugs can cause kidney damage, seizures, and cardiac arrest in a dog or cat. If you suspect your pet has consumed your medication — or anything toxic — call your veterinarian.
